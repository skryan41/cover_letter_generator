# cover_letter_generator
A python script to generate cover letter in Word and PDF format.

The script asks you to input company_name, position_name, relevant_skills, and whether or not you want the cover letter to be converted to PDF format.

In your cover_letter_template, make sure to include the above fields in the format of {{ field_name }} and the script will automatically generate the cover letter for you.
